## Features

- Supports color-coded diff output:
  - **Green** for added lines.
  - **Red** for removed lines.
- Toggle visibility of detailed file changes.
- Clear, concise instructions for users on how to interpret the diff.
- Persists user preferences for hiding instructions using local storage.
- Includes a footer for user feedback and bug reporting.
