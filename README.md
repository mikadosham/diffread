# DiffRead

**DiffRead** is a simple, minimalistic diff checker app built with React. It allows users to input diff code, view the changes in an easy-to-read format, and follow along with added or removed lines of code.

## Features

- Displays diffs in a clean and modern UI.
- Supports color-coded diff output:
  - **Green** for added lines.
  - **Red** for removed lines.
- Toggle visibility of detailed file changes.
- Clear, concise instructions for users on how to interpret the diff.
- Persists user preferences for hiding instructions using local storage.
- Includes a footer for user feedback and bug reporting.
